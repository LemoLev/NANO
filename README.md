# This is the NANO Mod
It requires Steamodded and Lovely _(lovely is required by steamodded)_ to install

How to install:
Follow the tutorial [here](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki), download the _Source code (zip)_ option on the latest release of the mod, and extract the contents of the zip archive into its own folder (the file structure should look like this: `.../Mods/NANO/<mod files>`, not `.../Mods/NANO/NANO/<mod files>` nor `.../Mods/<mod files>`)
