# This is the NANO Mod
It requires Steamodded and Lovely _(lovely is required by steamodded)_ to install

How to install:
Follow the tutorial on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUr0gXE77rk), but instead of downloading Cryptid, download this mod. (And you must install Lovely and Steamodded separately, that video is outdated)
